/**
 * I need to be able to access the field that models a list of values within a
 * generated bean to see if it has annotations on it that point to external
 * classes. This is one of the ways I discover externally mapped classes in the
 * codegen process.
 *
 * Unfortunately, there is no public getter on the field that contains these
 * annotations and even worse the AbstractListField class is not public so I can't have a
 * ref to it at compile time. Instead, I use the Class.forName trickery below in
 * order to get to the class and then make the field accessible which is a hack.
